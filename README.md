# QSpy
I wasn't too happy with the options there were for playing Spyfall online, and I wanted to have an opportunity to learn React, so I made QSpy.
QSpy is a web-based, mobile friendly Spyfall game which has:
- Rooms
- Kicking members
- Timed rounds
- Voting and location guessing
- Scores and ranking
- Much more!

This was 100% inspired by the fantastic **[codies.xyz](https://github.com/zikaeroh/codies)** so make sure to give that a star as well!<br>
I shamelessly copied a lot of the backend and, well, frontend architecture from Codies, but it was a great learning experience!
